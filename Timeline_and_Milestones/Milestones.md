## Milestones

#### Milestone 0: Written Research Paper - 4/1
By the end of the project, as an ongoing way of collecting our results and findings from the project, we will complete a research paper on the successes and failures of the ML modular security model. This includes drafting, editing, and “publishing”.

#### Milestone 1:  Completed Road Sign Detection Algorithms - 11/14
By November 11th, our goal is to have working supervised, semi supervised, and unsupervised road sign detection algorithms that can successfully, to some degree that is, process road sign data. 

#### Milestone 2: Integrate Road Sign Detection Algorithms into an Anomaly Detector - 12/1
The 3 algorithms, with each group member working on 1 each, will need to be compared and evaluated.  Ideally they will all agree.  If not, there is an anomaly and that anomaly needs to be rated on its severity.  

#### Milestone 3:  Completed Object Detection Algorithms - 1/1
The Object Detection Algorithm will be rather similar to the road sign detection algorithms but with a different dataset. We will have 3 algorithms, supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised here as well. It would be expected to have a faster turnaround time then the road sign detection as we would be more experienced in developing these AI modules

#### Milestone 4: Integrate Object Detection Algorithms into an Anomaly Detector - 1/14
Similar to the road sign anomaly detector, there will need to be a system that compares the output of the different algorithms and decides if there is an anomaly found in the data and if so, rate the anomaly’s severeness level.  

#### Milestone 5:  Completed GPS Algorithms - 2/1
The GPS Algorithm is a bit different to the other modules that we hope to develop for Smart Hack Smasher.  It is more numeric based rather than revolving around image recognition.  As such it should be easier to implement than the other algorithms

#### Milestone 6: Integrate GPS Algorithms into an Anomaly Detector - 2/14
Pretty much the same as the previous anomaly detectors, compare the algorithms, find if there is an anomaly, and if so, a severity rating.  

#### Milestone 7:  Integrate the Anomaly detectors from the 3 Modules - 3/1
The goal here is take the output of the 3 modules and analyze them.  There might be multiple modules outputting some form of an anomaly and in such a case, they will need to be looked at to determine which one is more severe.  As well, this integrated anomaly detector should package the anomaly ratings and information into a standardized package so that the information can be easily used by a variety of other applications.  The idea here is similar to an API.

#### Milestone 8: Clean up and Optimize Code, tie up loose ends, testing - 4/1
Ideally there will be plenty of time to test the application and ensure it works correctly.  The goal here is simply to have a well polished final result well before the actual date of the presentation.  

#### Milestone 9:  Design some Visual Component to Smart Hack Smasher-Presentation Date
Smart Hack Smasher is not exactly the most visual of ideas.  An anomaly detector/corrector that takes data from a car and outputs an API statement isn’t exactly the most flashy of things.  Given that, ideally we can create some visual representation of what would happen to a mock vehicle given the help of Smart Hack Smasher and doing a comparison of what would happen to the vehicle without it.
